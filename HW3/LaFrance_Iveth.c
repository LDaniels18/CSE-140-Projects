/*
instructions if using linux... to run you have to compile using gcc. 
use: gcc LaFrance_Iveth.c --this compiles the program (only use if you dont want to name an executable file)
next we have to create an executable file to show output:
use: gcc LaFrance_Iveth.c -o LaFrance_Iveth (this is prefered and make sure to use everytime you add or delete code)
finally we have to run the program using the executable file
use: ./LaFrance_Iveth (always use after compiling to see output)
